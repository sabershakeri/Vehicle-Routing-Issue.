The Bat meta-algorithm is used to solve the vehicle routing issue.

General goal:
Reduce the amount of time spent traveling in the city.

Specific goals:
1. Meet all consumer requests at the lowest possible cost.
2. Reduce the distribution distance traversed.
3. Reduce the number of trips made within the city.
4. Municipal transportation expenditures should be reduced.

Theories:
1. The distance traveled for medicine delivery in the city is minimized.
2. Routing reduces the cost of medicine delivery.
